<h1><a href="/blog/the-plan-to-kill-w3schools-part-2">Some Details on the Plan to Kill W3Schools</a></h1>

So I wrote a blog post Saturday explaining why I have
[been planning to kill W3Schools](/blog/why-im-killing-w3schools-and-you-can-too)
The post got quite
a response after I posted it to Hacker News. I honestly had no idea it would
strike such a nerve, and it left me more motivated than ever to get moving on
the [HTML and CSS Tutorial](/) project.

As you can imagine, all the positive response was countered -- to a much lesser
degree -- by detractors of the idea. So, I thought I'd write another post today
to: 1) explain my ideas in more detail, and 2) address some of the criticism
(much of it was constructive, by the way).

So here goes:

### 1) The post was juvenile
One commenter on Hacker News had [this to say](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6423237):

> Juvenile language and problem statement. Off putting pitch to developers that found W3Schools useful. At some point it'll have to switch to a more professional approach.

My response: Yes it is.

Taking a stand stirs up emotion and interests people in an idea. A
"professional approach" is boring. The HTML and CSS Tutorial will always be
useful, but it will also have character, take a stand, and just generally
inject more "fun" into your job of web development.

I'm sure it's off putting to some people, but those people will never really be
interested in the core message anyway.  It will never be professional
enough for them, or they'll scoff at the for-profit strategy vs a free, crowd
sourced one.  That's ok.  It's a big web with plenty of other learning and
reference sites out there. There is a place for everyone.

### 2) W3Schools is not really *that* bad.
Nope. It's not.

The W3Schools information architecture and navigation is better than most of
the other big reference sites out there.  Most of the content is pretty good.

However, at one point, over 100 people per minute were clicking on a headline which
read "Why I'm Planning to Kill W3Schools".  That says something.

Most of us (web developers) loath W3Schools. I think that is because it does
not *represent* good web development. There is no pride in craftsmanship there,
in a trade where quality is so important to us. One commenter in the Hacker News thread called this attitude towards quality,
craftsmanship, and aesthetic ["hipster"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6423802), and went on to say
the the poor aesthetic quality of W3Schools had no bearing on the content.

My problem with that comment is that it implies there needs to be a trade off
between usefulness, craftsmanship, and beauty.  I'm saying, why can't we have
our cake and eat it too?

<p class="callout">
I like cake.

(I know, I know, the current design of The HTML and CSS Tutorial is not great.
I'm only about 20% designer, and the rest of me is a code slinger. However,
I've already rectified that with a very talented designer: See "The job is too
big for one guy" below.)
</p>

### 3) Why Not Contribute to Effort XYZ
This Tweet came from a Mozilla employee whom I respect very much.

<div class="content">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Again kill w3schools - <a href="http://t.co/Lg6uddeF43">http://t.co/Lg6uddeF43</a> - by starting yet another resource? Why not add to existing ones? It is a full-time job.</p>&mdash; Christian Heilmann (@codepo8) <a href="https://twitter.com/codepo8/statuses/381488928781393920">September 21, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div>

Christian believes the best way to create better content is for everyone to
collaborate on a centralized, open source, content repository.

I disagree.

Building and managing a huge open source repository of words is like slogging
through mud. The democratic, crowd sourced way of doing things means the whole
thing moves way too slowly, and never really meets the demands of the market.

<p class="callout">
You know how a camel was invented?
</p>

__A committee was put together to design the perfect horse.__

The proof is in the pudding. W3Schools beats the
[Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
on almost every search query because W3Schools is designed to meet market
demands, not satisfy some ideology of its creators.

### 4) You're just doing this to get rich off the backs of contributors.
Yes and no.

Yes, I'm doing this to get rich, but there is a lot more to "riches" than
money. I talk about my motivations much more deeply in a post on my personal
blog called
[Life Strategy](http://www.kixx.name/blogs/kris_walker/life_strategy).
Also, see my comments in the section above and below to see why HTML and CSS
Tutorial needs to be a profit oriented venture. If it were not for profit, it
would not succeed.

Regarding contributions; I am *absolutely
not* engaging in a strategy to make money off the backs of unpaid contributors.
Most content will be created and edited by me. If
other folks want to contribute, that's fine, but I take responsibility for
making sure the HTML and CSS Tutorial fits the needs of the web development
community. So the burden of content creation and aggregation falls on me, not
the crowd.

Just because content will be released under a
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) , and hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kixxauth/htmlandcsstutorial_com)
does not mean I plan to outsource the work to the crowd. I believe that ideas,
content, and code are never really owned. Profit is made by the successful
execution and distribution of ideas, content, and code into a market which finds it
valuable enough to pay for.  There is no reason to tie profit to ownership. That's why
The HTML and CSS Tutorial will be licensed under a "copy left" structure.

So, you don't have to contribute. The HTML and CSS Tutorial is going to happen,
with or without you. If you want to contribute, then you are free to do so,
knowing that your content is free for others to use. If you really wanted to,
you could take all that content, and put up your own website. That's the beauty
of it.

### 5) The job is too big for one guy.
Yes it is.

But, one guy can get it started. One guy can make an online course and sell it
for a few bucks. And, with the money I hope to earn from the paid courses, I can
hire more editors, create more jobs, spin up more servers, and continue to grow
the whole mess into something really audacious.

<p class="callout">
Somebody needs to start.
</p>

And, just to drive the point home, I was so thrilled with the response you all
gave me, I went out and found a really
[talented designer](http://jimleszczynski.com/)
to help get The HTML and CSS Tutorial whipped into shape.  Jim is not doing this
for free, I wouldn't have asked him to, and if he offered to do it for free I
would have insisted on paying him.

### 6) Come back when you've actually done something.
I wrote a blog post that got nearly 25,000 visitors in less than 4 hours, and filled a
few pages of comments on more than one news aggregator site. Over 500 people
have signed up to keep up to date with The HTML and CSS Tutorial through my
email newsletter.

Through all that discourse over a single weekend I learned what the web
development community is passionate about. I found out how excited newbies
really are to learn this craft. And, I learned what is currently causing us
some pain and how it might be solved.

What did you do last weekend?

## The Near Future
I'm going to be releasing the first chunk of The HTML and CSS Tutorial soon. The folks on the
mailing list will be the first to know about it, as well as get the inside scoop on the
planning, strategy, and SEO tactics. So, make sure you're signed up below:
