    <h2>Kittens Are Dying</h2>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      If they&#39;re lucky, and young enough to be in school, a newbie might learn web development on
      <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>.
      We all know how that turns out:

      Looking at you
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1832251/1990885">MM_preloadImages</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they&#39;re a little less lucky, they&#39;ll turn to the googles and search
      &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+html">learn html</a>&quot; or
      &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+tutorial">html tutorial</a>&quot;
      and:
    </p>
    <p class="callout">
      Get an unyielding <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">pile of dung</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Or maybe they&#39;ll come accross a card carrying HTML expert on an internet forum
      who will tell them to:
    </p>
    <p class="callout">
      Go read the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/64057">spec</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Plan</h2>
    <p>
      We (web developers) need to create a comprehensive &quot;online book&quot;,
      with no paywall, which is fully crawlable by Google.
      It should cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and include a full reference section for each.
    </p>
    <p>So, I've started working on</p>
    <p class="callout">
      The HTML and CSS Tutorial<br>
    </p>
    <p class="info-callout"><em>
      Which currently only exists in the form of the web page you are staring at right now.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      The idea is that this online book will be a tasty treat for the Google index,
      and &mdash; hopefully &mdash;
      link bait for the whole web development and design community.
      Each section and reference snippet should have a URL to be easily linked to from places like
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of that, there should be high quality video tutorials.
      Some of them for free, and others for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="highlight">A win for everyone; FTW.</strong>

    <h2>I Need You</h2>
    <p>
      When a newbie asks you where to go to get started, wouldn't you like to have a place to send them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though this project will start off at the introductory level,
      and is probably beneath you, I still need you to help spread the word
      and establish some credibility in web development land.

      Get involved by dropping off your email address so that I can send an
