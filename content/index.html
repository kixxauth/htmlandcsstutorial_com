  <h2>What is this?</h2>

  <p>
    The HTML and CSS Tutorial is a learning and reference site for web designers and developers
    specifically created to replace the poor quality resources
    usually found at the top of search engine result pages.

  <h2>The Problem</h2>

  <p>
    If they&#39;re lucky, and young enough to be in school, a newbie might learn web development on
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>.
    We all know how that turns out:

    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1832251/1990885">MM_preloadImages</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If they&#39;re a little less lucky, they&#39;ll turn to the googles and search
    &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+html">learn html</a>&quot; or
    &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+tutorial">html tutorial</a>&quot;
    and:
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    Get an unyielding <a href="/blog/why-im-killing-w3schools-and-you-can-too">pile of dung</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or maybe they&#39;ll come accross a card carrying HTML expert on an internet forum
    who will tell them to:
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    Go read the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/64057">spec</a>.
  </p>

<section class="row content plan">
  <h2>The Plan</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="/blog/the-plan-to-kill-w3schools-part-2">The plan</a>
    is to create a comprehensive online resource,
    with no paywall, which is fully crawlable by Google.
    It should cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and include a full reference section for each.
  </p>
  <p>And, the kingpin of this plan is to financially support
    The HTML and CSS Tutorial with paid companion material like video
    tutorials, downloadable references, guides, and courseware.
    Hopefully this will avoid advertising and fundraising.
  </p>

  <h2>I Need You</h2>

  <p>
    When a newbie asks you where to go to get started, wouldn't you like to have a place to send them?
  </p>
  <p>
    I need you to help spread the word about The HTML and CSS Tutorial
    and establish some credibility in web development land.
    And, you'll get updates just prior to new stuff being published.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Why is this site trying to make money?</h3>
  <p><strong>a)</strong> I love building these resources and I hope to make it my full time job someday.
    I have a house to pay for, and two kids to feed.
  </p>
  <p><strong>b)</strong> Similar sites without a commercial motivation rely on community driven content,
    large financial backers, and "design by committee". I don't believe this is a recipe
    for success, when success is defined as getting the best material to reach the top
    of the search result pages.
  </p>

  <h3>Why don't you contribute to a community "open source" site?</h3>
  <p>Sites like the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>
    are top quality for getting thorough information about a topic.
    However, they have all the attributes of being "designed by committee";
    poor navigation, no useful summaries, no video examples, etc.
    In general these sites are just not very useful, and never will be.
    So, I set out to create something different.
  </p>

  <h3>This is a lot of work. What makes you think you can do it?</h3>
  <p>I can't do it alone. In addition to making this project my full time job
    someday, I hope to be able to hire people to help make the site more comprehensive
    and just better than anything else out there. In fact, I've already hired
    a <a href="http://jimleszczynski.com/">great designer</a>.
