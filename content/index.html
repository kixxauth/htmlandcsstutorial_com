  <h2>Kittens Are Dying</h2>
  <p>Because of the pile of crap served to newbies trying to learn web development.</p>
</section>
<section class="row copy">
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    If they&#39;re lucky, and young enough to be in school, a newbie might learn web development on
    <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a>.
    We all know how that turns out:
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    Looking at you
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1832251/1990885">MM_preloadImages</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If they&#39;re a little less lucky, they&#39;ll turn to the googles and search
    &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+html">learn html</a>&quot; or
    &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+tutorial">html tutorial</a>&quot;
    and:
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    Get an unyielding <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">pile of dung</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Or maybe they&#39;ll come accross a card carrying HTML expert on an internet forum
    who will tell them to:
  </p>
  <p class="callout">
    Go read the <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/64057">spec</a>.
  </p>

  <p><strong class="highlight">This situation needs improvement.</strong></p>

  <h2>The Plan</h2>
  <p>
    We (web developers) need to create a comprehensive &quot;online book&quot;,
    with no paywall, which is fully crawlable by Google.
    It should cover the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and include a full reference section for each.
  </p>
  <p>So, I've started working on</p>
  <p class="callout">
    The HTML and CSS Tutorial<br>
  </p>
  <p class="info-callout"><em>
    Which currently only exists in the form of the web page you are staring at right now.
  </em></p>
  <p>
    The idea is that this online book will be a tasty treat for the Google index,
    and &mdash; hopefully &mdash;
    link bait for the whole web development and design community.
    Each section and reference snippet should have a URL to be easily linked to from places like
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    On top of that, there should be high quality video tutorials.
    Some of them for free, and others for sale.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="highlight">A win for everyone; FTW.</strong>

  <h2>I Need You</h2>
  <p>
    When a newbie asks you where to go to get started, wouldn't you like to have a place to send them?
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though this project will start off at the introductory level,
    and is probably beneath you, I still need you to help spread the word
    and establish some credibility in web development land.

      Get involved by dropping off your email address so that I can send an
